<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-none">Skin Sleuth: An end-to-end skin disease classification app using YOLOv8, optimized for real-time Android deployment.

🧰 Tools & Technologies:
- Ultralytics YOLOv8n-cls
- Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow Lite
- Android Studio, XML, Java/Kotlin
- TFLite quantization & on-device inference

🔧 Workflow:
1. Data Preprocessing:
   - Curated and cleaned skin lesion dataset (Benign, Melanoma, etc.)
   - Performed normalization, resizing, and augmentation

2. Model Training:
   - Trained YOLOv8n-cls for skin disease classification
   - Tuned hyperparameters for best accuracy

3. Model Optimization:
   - Converted model to TensorFlow Lite
   - Applied post training quantization for lightweight deployment

4. Android Integration:
   - Integrated TFLite model into Android app
   - Enabled real-time image classification using camera/gallery input

🎯 Outcome:
✅ Accurate, mobile-optimized skin cancer classification  
✅ Operates offline, ideal for rural/low-connectivity areas  
✅ Lightweight app with fast prediction speed

  <h3>📷 FRAMS - Face Recognition Attendance Management System</h3>
  {% raw %}
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-none">Worked as an python full stack developer for A real-time face recognition-based attendance system designed for GCCA.

Workflow:
- Face image Capture using Computer vision.
- Face embedding generation via FaceNet
- Matching against stored encodings for identity verification

Core Features:
✅ Live webcam capture and automatic attendance marking  
✅ Secure login and user registration with facial data  
✅ Attendance logs stored in MySQL with timestamps  
✅ Admin panel for user management and record viewing  

Tools & Tech:
- Python, Flask, OpenCV, FaceNet
- MySQL (for persistent storage)
- HTML, CSS, Java-Script (for dashboard)

Impact:
✔️ Deployed in production with over 700+ active users  
✔️ Improved attendance tracking efficiency and eliminated proxies
